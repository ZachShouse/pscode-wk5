// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Chk if number is even or odd)
(if number is even
then print 'even'
if number is odd
then print 'odd'
end)


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


a (1,2,3,4,5)
b (average (1,2,3,4,5) = 3)
c (min(1,2,3,4,5) = 1 max(1,2,3,4,5) = 5)
d (results from b = 3, the average of five digits above) (results from c = the min is 1, the max is 5)
